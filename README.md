# NativeFx.Interop

This library provides only one file of more than ~80,000 lines of code, that is a `Natives.cs`
automatically generated by the [NativeAssist](https://github.com/WithLithum/NativeAssist)
tool, which generates wrappers for all native functions included in `alloc8or`'s `natives.json`.
